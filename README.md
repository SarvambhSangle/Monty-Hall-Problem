The Monty Hall Problem: A Python Simulation
This repository contains a Python program that simulates the classic Monty Hall problem. The simulation is designed to demonstrate, through empirical data, why switching your choice of door is the optimal strategy.

What is the Monty Hall Problem?
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, based on the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal." The scenario is as follows:

There are three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats.

You, the contestant, pick one door.

The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.

The host then offers you a choice: you can either stick with your initial door or switch to the remaining unopened door.

The question is, what should you do? Does it matter?

Our program simulates this scenario and provides a clear answer.

Key Features
1) Simulation of the Classic Problem: The program runs the simulation for the standard three-door scenario.

2) Four-Door Variation: It also includes a simulation for a more complex four-door version of the problem, as requested in the original exercise.

3) User-Defined Parameters: You can specify the number of doors and the number of simulation runs to test the theory with different parameters.

4) Empirical Results: The program outputs the win percentage for both "staying" and "switching" strategies, showing the counter-intuitive advantage of switching.
